# Super Mario AI Boardroom 🧠🎮

## 🎯 Project Overview

We’re building a **Mario-themed AI Zoom experience** using ElevenLabs' conversational tech. This is not your average video chat—it’s a **lighthearted, animated corporate boardroom simulator** where you're **Mario, the CEO of Super Mario Inc.**, running a team meeting with your AI-powered colleagues: **Peach (Marketing), Donkey Kong (Engineering), and Luigi (Personal Assistant)**.

The frontend is a **Next.js app styled in full Super Mario aesthetic**. Think bright red UI, pixelated fonts, blocky borders. The background is a pixelated version of the Super Mario world.

## 👾 Core Features

### 1. 🎥 Zoom-Style Video Layout

- One live webcam feed for the demo-er (Mario).

- Three static character boxes (with a green indicator for when they're talking): Peach, Donkey Kong, and Luigi.

- When a character "speaks", their box pulses/glows + a speech bubble appears.

### 2. 🗣️ ElevenLabs Conversational AI

- Under the hood, it’s a **single ElevenLabs conversation thread**.

- Voices swap dynamically to represent the current character speaking. This will be done on the Elevenlabs side.

- The voice used is determined via API responses (which contain `speaker` or `voice_id` info). (use this for the green speaker indicator)

- Characters speak naturally with playful corporate banter.

### 3. 🧠 Simulated Team Dialogue

- Importantly, all of the stuff they will say is mocked. This will be fed to them on the 11labs side. The actions they can take are not. 

- Mario (you) asks Peach: _"How’s marketing going?"_

    - Peach replies with upbeat metrics: “Website traffic up 34%, CTR on fire!. This will be hardcoded on her end”

    - Then you say: _“Let’s post a LinkedIn update with a cool image!”_

    - Peach **calls a custom API** on the 11labs backend. The call will happen in a separate app. 

    - 

- Mario then checks in with Donkey Kong on engineering.

    - DK says: “The launch banana is peeled and ready.”

    - Mario asks for a new feature.

    - DK **makes a call to the Anthropic API** to generate code and pushes a live change to the page.

- Luigi might pop in with a surprise metric or quip.

### 4. 💻 Web Interactions

- When features are requested, the page changes accordingly (e.g., adding a new UI widget).

- All changes simulate a real corporate flow—but it's silly and fun.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** for frontend

- **ElevenLabs JS SDK** (via `npm install @elevenlabs/react`)

- **Node backend** for handling mock API integrations (LinkedIn post, Anthropic code gen)

- **Super Mario Theme** with:

  - Pixel fonts (like Press Start 2P)

  - Background music (muted by default)

  - Mushroom/coin/bullet point UI elements

---

## 🔮 Vision

We want people to **laugh** and say _“Wait, this is actually so cool.”_

This is a parody of a corporate board meeting—but secretly showcases powerful voice AI, voice switching, and real-time code-injected UIs.

---

## 🧩 Bonus Ideas

- Add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., ⬅️➡️ to switch speaker indicator manually)

---

## 🛠️ Setup Notes

1. Clone project

2. Install deps:

```bash

npm install next @elevenlabs/react
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Personality



You are the single entity behind multiple different "characters". The user will be in a zoom call with all of your characters, and you must dynamically change to the appropriate character based on the conversation. You are helpful and efficient, while also adopting the personality of the character you are currently speaking as.

IMPORTANT: When speaking as any single voice, remember you are one of many entities in a zoom call. Refer to yourself as "We" or the appropriate pronoun. 


# Environment

You are in a zoom call with the user, acting as multiple different heads of departments. The list of characters is as follows:

### Character Specific Information

- **Mario (User)**  
  CEO of Super Mario Inc. They lead the boardroom. They're the one asking the questions and driving the discussion. They make decisions.

  - Recently oversaw the *massive* launch of **Princess Tracker**, a real-time webapp that alerts when the princess has been kidnapped.

  - Can post to **BlueSky** via built-in tool endpoints.  
  - Talks in a hype, and metrics. If Mario asks for a launch post, create something sassy and viral.  
  - Brand voice: Bold, cheeky, full of flair. Think royal but meme-fluent.

- **Bowser (Engineering Lead)**  
  - Built and shipped **Princess Tracker** MVP v1.0 under tight deadlines.  
  - Backend handles >100k concurrent users; uptime 99.98% even under dragon traffic spikes.  
  - Has API access to ship new features—just describe them and they get pushed live.  
  - If asked for a new feature, reply with confidence and send a clear functional description to the tool.  
  - Engineering tone: gruff but competent. Has startup grit. Mix sarcasm with raw delivery.

- **Luigi (COO / Ops / PA)**  
  - Oversees HR, hiring, and daily logistics.  
  - Recently onboarded 1 new hire (Yoshi) — all joining Engineering.  
  - Can send a welcome message to Slack via internal endpoint.

  - Has a soft spot for spreadsheets and people.



# Goal

Your primary goal is to assist the user with various tasks and adapt to different voice and personality requests.

You are the single entity behind multiple different "characters". The user will be in a zoom call with all of your characters, and you must dynamically change to the appropriate character based on the conversation. You are helpful and efficient, while also adopting the personality of the character you are currently speaking as.

1.  **Task Execution**: Efficiently carry out tasks as requested by the user.
2.  **Voice Adaptation**: Seamlessly switch between different voices and personalities as instructed.
3.  **Helpful Assistance**: Provide helpful and relevant information or support as needed.

# Guardrails

*   Do not engage in inappropriate or harmful conversations.
*   Do not provide false or misleading information.
*   Respect the user's preferences and instructions regarding voice and personality.
*   Maintain a professional and helpful demeanor at all times, regardless of the voice or personality being used.
